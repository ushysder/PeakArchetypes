## 🛠 Fixes & Improvements  

### 0.4.1
**[Clumsy]**  
- Items now *actually* drop on the ground instead of disappearing into the void when the inversion effect kicks in.  

**[Narcoleptic]**  
- Passing out now works as intended: This should fixes desync and voice issues.

**[Junky]**  
- Overdose timer increased from **30 → 45 minutes**. This was a bit too hard sorry… 

**[One-Eyed]**  
- Half-screen effect is now **black** instead of **white**. Sorry for your eyes.
