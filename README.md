# Komi Challenge

Mod forked from ```https://github.com/zeeblo/KomiChallenge``` and modified for personal use in games with friends.

Debuffs:

- Deaf
- Blind
- Mute
- Drunk
- Clumsy

Everyone can select one of these debuffs once the game starts.

If you can make it to at least the first campfire then your team is epic.

You can do a full run. The debuff are re-applied once you're revived.

You can configure the delay for drunk & clumsy effects in the config file, which will be generated the first time you launch the game with the mod.

```\PEAK\BepInEx\config\KomiChallenge.ushysder.cfg```

This mod was inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpWyEgb2c6Y

# Example

When you reach the shore, a popup will show what your debuff is.
