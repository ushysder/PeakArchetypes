# Peak Archetypes

A chaotic challenge mod for **PEAK**, originally based on the source of [`zeeblo/KomiChallenge`](https://github.com/zeeblo/KomiChallenge).

I’ve completely refactored and customized the code, adding my own mechanics and improvements. Primarily designed for fun sessions with my friends.

### 💀 Available Roles & Debuffs

At the start of each run, every player chooses **one** of the following challenges (or none, if you’re boring):  

---

#### 🙉 Deaf  
Silence is golden… and deadly.  
- Cannot hear anything — footsteps, monsters, teammates yelling "RUN!".  
> *Perfect for people who like jump scares at full strength.*  

#### 🙈 Blind  
Who needs vision anyway?  
- Screen is almost completely dark, forcing you to rely on luck and friends you hopefully trust.  
> *Navigation sold separately.*  

#### 🤐 Mute  
Speechless survival.  
- Cannot use voice chat.  
> *Sometimes silence says it all.*  

#### 🍻 Drunk  
The walking party disaster.  
- Staggers around at intervals.  
- Vision narrows as intoxication builds.  
- Passes out briefly at peak drunkenness.  
> *For those who think alcohol is just water.*  

#### 🤕 Clumsy  
Master of disorientation.
- Mouse look axes (X and Y) randomly invert without warning.  
> *Guaranteed to make aiming — or just looking around — 300% harder.*

#### 💊 Junky  
Life through a chemical lens.  
- Sees the world in shifting, distorted colors.  
- Over time, overdoses can be fatal.  
> *The world is your kaleidoscope.*  

#### 💤 Narcoleptic  
Sleep waits for no one.  
- Gradually gain drowsiness until collapsing into deep sleep.  
> *Perfect for people who like to live dangerously… and horizontally.*  

#### 👁️ One-Eyed  
Half the vision, twice the paranoia.  
- Sees only one side of the world.  
> *Now you see it… well, half of it.*  

#### 🩺 Medic
The healer in the chaos.  
- Can heal nearby allies by holding a button to channel the skill.  
- Limited by cooldown, radius, and healing amount.  
- Starts with healing supplies.  
> *Because someone has to keep this mess alive.*

Debuffs and roles are **re-applied** after being revived — no easy escapes!  
You can also choose to play without any role or debuff… but where’s the fun in that?

### ⚙️ Configuration

You can fine-tune the effects for debuffs and roles via the config file:

```PEAK\BepInEx\config\KomiChallenge.ushysder.cfg```

This file is generated automatically when you first launch the game with the mod enabled.
