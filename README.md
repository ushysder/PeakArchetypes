# Komi Challenge

A chaotic challenge mod for **PEAK**, originally forked from [`zeeblo/KomiChallenge`](https://github.com/zeeblo/KomiChallenge), with custom tweaks I made for games with my friends.

### 💀 Available Debuffs

At the start of each run, every player choose one of the following debuffs:

- **Deaf** – Can't hear anything.
- **Blind** – Vision? Who needs it.
- **Mute** – Say goodbye to your voice lines.
- **Drunk** – Randomly falls over. Cheers!
- **Clumsy** – Occasionally loses control as movement inputs are suddenly inverted.
- **Junky** – Sees the world differently and can die of overdose.
- **Narcoleptic** – Gradually drifts off and collapses into sleep.

Survive with these conditions... if you can.

Debuffs are **re-applied** after being revived — no easy escapes!

The player can also choose to play without any debuff.

### ⚙️ Configuration

You can fine-tune the delays for **Drunk**, **Clumsy**, and **Narcoleptic** effects via the config file:

```PEAK\BepInEx\config\KomiChallenge.ushysder.cfg```

This file is generated automatically when you first launch the game with the mod enabled.
