# Peak Archetypes

A chaotic challenge mod for **PEAK**, originally based on the source of [`zeeblo/KomiChallenge`](https://github.com/zeeblo/KomiChallenge).

I’ve completely refactored and customized the code, adding my own mechanics and improvements. Primarily designed for fun sessions with my friends.

### 💀 Available Roles & Debuffs

At the start of each run, every player chooses **one** of the following challenges (or none, if you’re boring):

---

#### 🙉 Deaf

Silence is golden… and deadly.

- Cannot hear anything — footsteps, monsters, teammates yelling "RUN!".
  > _Perfect for people who like jump scares at full strength._

#### 🙈 Blind

Who needs vision anyway?

- Screen is almost completely dark, forcing you to rely on luck and friends you hopefully trust.
  > _Navigation sold separately._

#### 🤐 Mute

Speechless survival.

- Cannot use voice chat.
  > _Sometimes silence says it all._

#### 🍻 Drunk

The walking party disaster.

- Staggers around at intervals.
- Vision narrows as intoxication builds.
- Passes out briefly at peak drunkenness.
  > _For those who think alcohol is just water._

#### 🤕 Clumsy

Master of disorientation.

- Mouse look axes (X and Y) randomly invert without warning.
- Sometimes you'll drop an item from your inventory onto the ground.
  > _Guaranteed to make aiming — or just looking around — 300% harder._

#### 💊 Junky

Life through a chemical lens.

- Sees the world in shifting, distorted colors.
- Over time, overdoses can be fatal.
  > _The world is your kaleidoscope._

#### 💤 Narcoleptic

Sleep waits for no one.

- Gradually gain drowsiness until collapsing into deep sleep.
  > _Perfect for people who like to live dangerously… and horizontally._

#### 👁️ One-Eyed

Half the vision, twice the paranoia.

- Perceives only one side of the world.
- Permanently loses part of max HP.
  > _You don’t miss much… except everything on your blind side._

#### 🩺 Medic

The healer in the chaos.

- Can heal nearby allies by holding a button to channel the skill.
- Limited by cooldown, radius, and healing amount.
- Starts with healing supplies.
  > _Because someone has to keep this mess alive._

Debuffs and roles are **re-applied** after being revived — no easy escapes!  
You can also choose to play without any role or debuff… but where’s the fun in that?

### ⚙️ Configuration

You can fine-tune the effects for debuffs and roles via the config file:

`PEAK\BepInEx\config\ushysder.PeakArchetypes.cfg`

This file is generated automatically when you first launch the game with the mod enabled.
