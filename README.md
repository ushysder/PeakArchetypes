# Komi Challenge

Debuffs:

- Deaf
- Blind
- Mute
- Drunk
- Clumsy

Everyone can select one of these debuffs once the game starts.
If you can make it to at least the first campfire then your team is epic.
You can do a full run. The debuff are re-applied once you're revived.

This mod was inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpWyEgb2c6Y

When you reach the shore, a popup will show what your debuff is.
